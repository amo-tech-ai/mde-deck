# MDE.AI Pitch Deck Builder: Content Plan & Copywriting Guide

## 1. Tone & Voice Guidelines

Our voice is your AI co-founder: intelligent, supportive, and focused on your success.

*   **Confident, Not Arrogant:** We know our product is powerful, but we present it as a tool to elevate the user's own great ideas.
*   **Helpful, Not Hand-Holding:** We guide users with clear, simple language, trusting their intelligence to take the lead.
*   **Modern & Human:** We speak like people, not robots. The tone is professional yet conversational, avoiding overly technical jargon.
*   **Inspiring & Action-Oriented:** We motivate founders by focusing on what they can achieve, encouraging them to take the next step.

## 2. Content Style Guide

*   **Sentences:** Short, clear, and to the point.
*   **Voice:** Always use the active voice (e.g., "Create your deck" instead of "Your deck can be created").
*   **Jargon:** Avoid corporate buzzwords. Instead of "synergize solutions," say "work together to solve problems."
*   **Pronouns:** Use "You" and "Your" to speak directly to the user. Use "We" and "Our" to refer to MDE.AI.
